The main types of messages found in these logs include: USER_END, CRED_DISP, USER_ERR, SERVICE_START, SERVICE_STOP, USER_ACCT, USER_CMD, CRED_REFR, and USER_START. These log messages are from the auditd daemon that writes audit records to the disk. Another type of log message is of unknown type.

1. USER_END: This type of message contains information about a user session that has ended. Key details include: PID (process id), UID (User ID), session ID, operation (op), user's accounting information, executable (exe), IP address (addr), terminal, whether operation was successful or not (res=success).

2. CRED_DISP: This is generated when user credentials are disposed of. Information is similar to USER_END message.

3. USER_ERR: This type indicates a user error. In the case above, it shows that there was an error with user authentication (PAM:bad_ident). Key details include pid, uid, operation, executable, IP address, terminal, and the unsuccessful result of the operation.

4. SERVICE_START and SERVICE_STOP: These messages are written when a system service starts and when the service stops. Key details include PID, User ID, comm (command name), and result(res).

5. USER_ACCT, USER_CMD, CRED_REFR, USER_START: These are related to user operations like accounting, user command, credentials refresh, and session start. These logs provide operational details about the user's activities on the server.

There are recurring patterns in these logs. The system often logs when a system service starts and when the service stops. It also logs on USER_END and CRED_DISP consecutively, which suggests user sessions are ending frequently. There also seems to be frequent audited sudo commands (based on USER_CMD entries).

The error "PAM:bad_ident" could be caused by failed SSH authentication from an unrecognised user or a bot, judging from the unknown account and the remote IP address.

Based on the logs, the system seems to be functioning correctly, as most entries are successful. However, there is potential suspicious activity related to unauthorized SSH activities, which may require further investigation to ensure it's not a severe security threat. A deeper review of the failed SSH attempts is recommended.
