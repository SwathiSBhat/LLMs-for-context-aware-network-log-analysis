The main types of messages present in these logs are informational messages.

For the ansible-async_wrapper.py process info messages, the logs include the timestamp, the name of the virtual machine (vm-1a or vm-2a), the ansible-async_wrapper.py process identifier, status of the process (it's still running) and its associated process number.

For the ICMP packets, related logs show the timestamp, the inbound and outbound interfaces, MAC, source and destination IP addresses, length of the packet, Type of Service, Precedence, Time to Live, Identification, DF, protocol type, ICMP type and code, associated ID and sequence number. 

Recurring patterns present include the continual running of the ansible-async_wrapper.py script and arrival of ICMP echo request packets on vm-1a.

There isn't any errors or warnings in these logs. They are informational logs indicating the operation of ansible-async_wrapper.py script and ICMP packets received by the vm-1a. 

Based on these logs, the overall health and status of vm-2a and vm-1a systems seem to be normal. Both machines have an Ansible-related process (ansible-async_wrapper.py) continously running, which could suggest there are automated management tasks taking place. vm-1a is receiving outside network ICMP traffic, more specifically ICMP echo requests. Without additional information it can't be determined whether this is expected or anomalous behavior, though it could suggest the system is network accessible from the sources specified in logs.
