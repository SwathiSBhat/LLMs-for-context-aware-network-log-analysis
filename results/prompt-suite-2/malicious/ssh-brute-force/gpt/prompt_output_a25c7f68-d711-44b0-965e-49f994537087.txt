The main types of messages in these logs are USER_LOGIN and USER_ERR. 

The USER_LOGIN messages detail attempts to login to the system characterized by a unique process ID (pid), user ID (uid), and Action User ID (auid). It logs the session (ses), the state of the user (subj), the operation executed (op), an account (acct), details of the executable file (exe), IP address of the source (addr), terminal used for login, and the result of the operation (res).

The USER_ERR messages indicate errors related to user accounts and their authentication state. They also include details of the user, operation, executable detail and source IP just like the USER_LOGIN messages.

Recurring patterns and repeated messages can be observed. Multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address (112.172.237.26) are evident in the logs. These attempts are being made using different account names. PAM protocol errors are also flagged multiple times.

The repeated failures in login and USER_ERR messages suggest possible unauthorized attempts to gain access to the system. The 'PAM:bad_ident' error indicates that the PAM module was unable to identify the user trying to authenticate, this usually occurs when an invalid username or credentials are supplied.

The overall health and status of the system appear to be at risk. The repeated attempts from the same IP address following a specific pattern - failed login attempts followed by data related to the 'PAM:bad_ident' error - indicate a possible brute force attack. However, the system seems to be functioning correctly as it's refusing the login attempts with invalid credentials. 

Immediate action should be taken to mitigate the potential threat: further investigation into the IP address, blocking it if it's confirmed malicious, and enhancing security measures to prevent future brute force attacks. It would also be advisable to check and upgrade the security of user credentials and increase the system's intrusion detection capabilities.
