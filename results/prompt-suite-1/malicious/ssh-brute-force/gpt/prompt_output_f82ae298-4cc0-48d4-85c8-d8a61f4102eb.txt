1. Main types of messages in these logs: These logs display error messages only.

2. Key details provided: These error messages provide crucial details about the error encountered:
    - Timestamp indicating when the error occurred. 
    - Process id (pid) and User ID (uid) that was attempting the operation.
    - auid and ses values: These values refer to the Audit User ID and Session ID respectively.
    - Message type, operation, grantors and account: These fields offer specific details about the type of operation that failed.
    - Hostname and addr: These indicate the hostname and IP address from where the login attempts come.
    - Terminal used: Generally will display the type of protocol used. In these cases, ssh protocol was used.
    - Result of operation: This is marked as "failed" in these cases.
3. Recurring patterns or repeated messages: There are recurrent failed login attempts via ssh protocol from different IP addresses (159.223.198.36, 169.231.25.179, etc.).
4. Potential causes of the errors or warnings: The errors seem to be related to failed login attempts. The user associated with these attempts is often 'student' or unidentified (?). This suggests an incorrect username may have been used or intrusion attempts might be in progress.
5. Overall health and status: The system appears to be experiencing multiple failed login attempts, possibly indicative of an ongoing brute force attack. An audit and tightening of security measures, such as re-visiting the ssh login process and ensuring strict password policies might be required. However, without error logs related to system performance, it's not possible to provide a full summary of the system's overall health.
