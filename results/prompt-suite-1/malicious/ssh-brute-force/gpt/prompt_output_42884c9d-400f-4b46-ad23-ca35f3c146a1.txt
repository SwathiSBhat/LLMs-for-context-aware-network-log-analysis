The main types of messages in these logs are USER_LOGIN and USER_ERR. The logs contain no identified warnings or info messages.

USER_LOGIN messages provide key details like the operation (op=login), user account (acct), executable path (exe), source IP address (addr), and terminal used. The IP address indicates the source of login request, and 'res' attribute tells the result of the operation. In all these provided logs, the login attempt failed.

USER_ERR messages mainly provide information about an operation (op) that failed due to a bad identification (PAM:bad_ident). This type of message includes the process ID (pid), the user ID (uid), the audit user ID (auid), and the session ID (ses). It also includes the hostname and the IP address where the erroneous operation was performed, as well as the terminal type. 'res' denotes the result of the operation, which in this case, is failed.

Recurring patterns include repeated failed login attempts from different IP addresses and that the login attempts are being made via SSH. Moreover, each failed login attempt is followed by a USER_ERR with a bad identification contributing to the failure.

The potential causes of these errors could be unauthorized or illegitimate users trying to access the system using invalid credentials through an SSH login attempt. These could be potential signs of a brute-force attack. The USER_ERR logs are possibly caused by invalid or non-existent usernames being used to access the system, leading to bad identification errors.

Based on these logs, the system might have security concerns. There are numerous failed login attempts from different IP addresses, indicating potential unauthorized access attempts. However, the system appears to be secure as all such attempts have failed. The overall health of the system can't be determined solely based on the failed login attempts. Other system logs and performance metrics might be needed for an overall health check.
