The main types of messages in these logs are:
1. Informational messages: These are normal operational messages emitted by the systems. Typically these include the Ansible automation engine logs and Kernel logs.

Key details provided by these messages include:

Ansible logs:
- The timestamp at which the log was recorded.
- The virtual machine generating the log.
- The script being run (ansible-async_wrapper.py)
- Job ID being processed (e.g. 2238)
- The status of the job (e.g., "still running")
- The message ID pertaining to the job status (e.g. 31535205)

Kernel logs:
- The timestamp at which the log was recorded.
- The virtual machine generating the log.
- The protocol of the incoming network packets (e.g., ICMP).
- Details about the incoming packets, including the source and destination IP addresses, TTL (Time To Live), ID, Protocol, Type, Code, ID, Sequence etc.

2. Unknown messages: These messages are found in the 'audit.log' of vm-2a. No further details can be determined since the content of these logs is not provided.

From the information provided, there appears to be a recurring pattern of ICMP packets (Internet Control Message Protocol, used in network devices to send error messages) being logged in the kernel logs. These are likely responses from network pinging activities. 

It is also observed that there are recurring Ansible tasks being run, which could either be part of routine system checks or other administrative tasks. 

The audit logs records are listed as 'Unknown' due to which it is not possible to provide potential causes for errors or warnings.

Based on these logs, both vm-1a and vm-2a seem to be functioning normally. Networking activities are occurring as shown by the ICMP entries in vm-1a's logs. In addition, regular automated operations are running as indicated by Ansible entries in both VM logs.

For the unknown audit logs, without further context or information, it cannot be identified what these messages stand for, hence it cannot be concluded how they affect the overall system health.
