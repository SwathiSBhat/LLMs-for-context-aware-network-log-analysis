1. The main types of messages in these logs are information messages. 

2. For each type of information messages, the key details provided are:
   - For the Ansible logs: the Ansible task ID (2238 for vm-2a, 2229 for vm-1a) and its status stating whether the task is still running or completed.
   - For the kernel logs: the details about Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, such as the source, destination, packet length, type, code, ID, sequence number, and so on.
   - For the unknown logs: it's hard to assume the details as they're marked as "unknown". 

3. The recurring patterns or repeated messages are:
    - ICMP packet information messages: These messages record the details of ICMP packets received by the system.
    - Ansible execution messages: These messages provide state of the running tasks in Ansible, indicating that multiple tasks are still running.

4. There are no errors or warnings in the provided logs, only informational messages. Consequently, we cannot provide potential causes for errors or warnings. 

5. Based on these logs, the overall health and status of the system seem to be normal. No errors or warnings are indicated, though there are multiple ongoing Ansible tasks providing automation of system operations. Numerous inbound ICMP packets are logged; if these are expected, regular traffic patterns, they do not indicate a problem. However, a large volume of ICMP traffic could be a symptom of a denial of service attack or network scanning activity. This would need further investigation. The "unknown" logs may indicate an issue, but without further information, we can't draw conclusions on their implication. It would be beneficial to examine those logs in more detail.
