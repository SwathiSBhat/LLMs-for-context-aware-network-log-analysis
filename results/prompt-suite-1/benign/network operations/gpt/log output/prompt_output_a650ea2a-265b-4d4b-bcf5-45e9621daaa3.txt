The main types of messages are:

1. USER_ACCT: These messages record events related to user account management.
2. CRED_ACQ: These logs are generated when credentials are acquired. 
3. LOGIN: Logs that are generated during login processes.
4. SYSCALL: Logs that are created when a software invokes a system call.
5. PROCTITLE: These logs contain the proctitle set by a process.
6. USER_START: These logs indicate the start of a new user session.
7. USER_END: These logs indicate the end of a user session.
8. CRED_DISP: These logs are generated when credentials are disposed of.

For each type of message, key details provided include operation type, process ID, user ID, audit ID, session ID, subject, the executable involved in the operation, hostname of the system, user's IP address, and the outcome of the operation.

The recurring pattern in these logs is the authentication and session management for the user "professor" via SSH. Activities include account verification, login, credential acquisition, session initiation, and session closure.

There're no errors or warnings indicated in these logs. These are routine system logs that would be expected during a successful user login sequence via SSH.

Based on these logs, the overall health and status of the system seem normal. The logs indicate that the user "professor" is successfully able to authenticate, start sessions, and end sessions via ssh which proves that those services are running as expected. There are no error or warning messages, which indicates that there are no immediate issues that need addressing according to these logs.
