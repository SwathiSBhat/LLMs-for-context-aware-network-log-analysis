The main types of messages in these logs can be categorized as user account actions, user credential changes, login actions, syscall executions, proctitle sets, session opens, and errors. 

Key details provided for each type of message are:

- User Account Actions (USER_ACCT): This reveals the operation attempted by the user on the account, showing whether the operation was successful or not.
- User Credentials Changes (CRED_ACQ & CRED_DISP): These messages indicate changes to user credentials, specifying the type of operation, the user and the result of the operation.
- Login Actions (LOGIN): This logs an identity change event, typically associated with user login.
- Syscall Executions (SYSCALL): These messages record system call activity.
- Proctitle Sets (PROCTITLE): These represent the process title for a session.
- Session Opens (USER_START & USER_END): These indicate the start and end of a user session.
- Errors (USER_ERR): These messages record any errors occurred in the system.

A recurring pattern in these logs is the successful operations related to user account actions, credential changes, login actions, syscall executions, and session opens. All operations have "res=success" indicating that the operations were successful.

The only error message in these logs originates from "vm-1a" and is of type USER_ERR. This error indicates an unsuccessful identity match during a login attempt via Secure Shell (SSH) connection. The potential cause could be an unauthenticated or unauthorized user attempting to access the system.

As for the overall health and status of the systems based on these logs, "vm-2a" seems to function normally with all operations being successful. However, "vm-1a" experienced an unauthorized login attempt, which may suggest a potential security issue, but no security breach or compromised operation is evident from these logs.
