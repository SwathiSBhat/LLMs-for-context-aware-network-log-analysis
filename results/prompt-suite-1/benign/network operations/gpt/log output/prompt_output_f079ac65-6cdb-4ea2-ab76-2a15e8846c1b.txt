The main types of messages in these logs are:

1. USER_ACCT: This indicates activities related to user accounts such as creation, deletion, or changes.
2. CRED_ACQ: Represents instances where credentials were acquired.
3. LOGIN: Logs related to user logins.
4. SYSCALL: System calls from the kernel, useful in debugging or security inspection.
5. PROCTITLE: The command for a specific process, useful in identifying what was running at a specific time.
6. USER_START: Indicates the initiation of a user session.
7. USER_END: Indicates the end of a user session.
8. CRED_DISP: Represents the dismissal of credentials.
9. USER_LOGIN: Detailed logs related to user logins.
10. USER_ERR: Error messages related to users or sessions.
11. Unknown: The sources, reasons or details for these logs are unknown.

For each of these messages, key details like timestamp, operation, process ID (pid), user ID (uid), audit user ID (auid), session (ses), subject (subj), hostname, address (addr), terminal, and the result of operation (res) are provided.

There are some recurring patterns in these logs. For example, it appears that a user account "professor" logged in successfully several times from the same address (68.108.247.157) using SSH.

The error logs (USER_ERR) indicate that there were failed login attempts from address 103.233.94.20. The reasons of the failure is specified as bad username, suggesting that either invalid or nonexistent usernames were used for login attempts. 

Based on these logs, the overall system health seems satisfactory. However, the failed login attempts from the same address might suggest that the system could be a target of malicious login attempts (potential hacking attempts). Regular monitoring of logs and strengthening the security mechanisms in place would be beneficial to prevent any unwanted access to the system.
