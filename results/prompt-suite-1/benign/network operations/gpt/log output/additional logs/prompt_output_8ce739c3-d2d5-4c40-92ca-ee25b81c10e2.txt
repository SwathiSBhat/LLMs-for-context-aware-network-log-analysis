Types of messages in these logs:
1. Informational: The main messages are informational in these logs, especially from Ansible and the kernel. Ansible messages indicate that a particular task is "still running", with the task number and an identifier provided. Kernel messages specify details about ICMP packets, including their inbound and outbound traffic, MAC addresses, source and destination addresses, length of the package, and other details.
2. Unknown: Many audit log entries are marked as "unknown", which implies that the content of these entries couldn't be represented in the output for some reason.

Key details provided in these messages include:
- The file name and the timestamp when a message was logged
- The system where the log was recorded (e.g., vm-1a, vm-2a)
- The type of message (like task running or ICMP packet details)
- In the case of Ansible, the task number and an identifier
- For kernel messages, details about the traffic and packet characteristics

Recurring patterns and repeated messages:
The most frequently recurring pattern is the "ansible-async_wrapper.py: {task_id} still running ({identifier})" messages from Ansible, which implies that certain asynchronous tasks are taking longer than anticipated. These messages are seen for different task IDs and identifiers and appear to repeat every few seconds.
