1. Types of Messages:
   The logs primarily consist of 'unknown' records from the 'audit.log' file and the status messages from the 'syslog' file. The 'unknown' records could be of any type such as errors, warnings, or info and we don't have more information about these from the given logs. The 'syslog' mostly contains informational status messages which suggest that a script named 'ansible-async_wrapper.py' is running.

2. Key Details Provided:
   For the 'unknown' records from 'audit.log', no specific details are provided which could be used to determine the type or further details about the events. The 'syslog' messages, however, provide the following key details:
    - Date & Time of the log record: this helps to understand when the specific event occurred.
    - The script which is running: 'ansible-async_wrapper.py'
    - The identification number of the process running ('2232' and '2240') and another identifying number with seven digits.
      
3. Recurring Patterns or Repeated Messages:
   There are many recurring 'unknown' messages in the 'audit.log' which seem to occur every few milliseconds. In 'syslog' file, there are recurrent messages for an Ansible script running on both 'vm-1a' and 'vm-2a', which suggests that there is some automated task being performed using Ansible.

4. Potential Causes of Errors or Warnings:
   Since no specific errors or warnings are given in the logs, it is difficult to speculate on potential causes. However, the repetitive 'unknown' logs in 'audit.log' could suggest an issue with the logging system itself, perhaps due to a configuration issue or a bug.

5. Overall Health and Status of the System:
   Based on these logs, it's difficult to gauge the overall health and status of the system due to lack of specific and meaningful data. The 'unknown' records are concerning due to their frequency and uninformative nature. They could potentially indicate a system issue. On the other hand, the 'syslog' suggests that there are automated tasks being run successfully using Ansible. Since no specific warnings or errors are present in these logs, it's safe to assume the system is operational but due to unknown logs a thorough examination is recommended.
