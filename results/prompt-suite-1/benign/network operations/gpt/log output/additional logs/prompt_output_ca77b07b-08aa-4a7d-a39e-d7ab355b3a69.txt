Types of messages in these logs:
1) Info: Majority of the records from "vm-2a" and "vm-1a" are informative messages that indicate ansible runs (Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool). These records provide a timestamp of execution, the job identifier, and the status that the process is still running.

2) Unknown: The messages in the audit.log do not provide any understandable or meaningful information. More context is required to understand these entries.

Key details provided:
1) For info messages, the key details are Task name ("ansible-async_wrapper.py"), Task ID (2232 and 2240), the timestamp (e.g., Jun 5 16:34:13), and the running time of the task in the brackets.

2) For unknown audit.log entries, there are no key details provided. The content of these logs is stated as "unknown".

Recurring patterns or repeated messages:
1) Info messages: The "ansible-async_wrapper.py" task is running at certain intervals, as seen in the logs for both "vm-2a" and "vm-1a". 
2) Unknown messages: This is a recurring pattern in the logs, but what it indicates cannot be determined without further context.

Potential Causes of errors or warnings:
No specific errors or warnings are observed in the provided logs. However, the repeated "unknown" messages in audit.log could indicate a logging issue or problem with a logging service.

System Health and Status:
The syslog entries for both "vm-2a" and "vm-1a" suggest that the system's ansible tasks are running as expected without indicating any errors or failures, which tends to be a positive sign for overall system health. However, the large number of "unknown" records in the audit logs suggests that some aspects of the system are not operating correctly or are not providing useful logging information. The cause of these "unknown" records would need to be investigated to fully assess system health.
