The main types of logs present here include System Logs (from /var/log/syslog) and Audit Logs (/var/log/audit/audit.log).

1. System Logs: These logs are mostly considered as informational messages. They provide the following key details:
   - Timestamp of the event.
   - Name of the machine where the event occurred.
   - The process or service that triggered the event.
   - Status or the output of the process execution.

2. Audit Logs: Due to missing specifics on these logs in the provided data, it's unclear what details they contain. Audit Logs typically hold information on security-relevant events, user activities and system/app configuration changes.

A repetitive pattern observed is the "ansible-async_wrapper.py" still running message on both vm-1a and vm-2a. These messages likely relate to a long-running task initiated by the Ansible automation tool in an Asynchronous mode.

Without information on what "unknown" means in the Audit logs, it is difficult to provide a possible cause for these records. However, typically, an unknown error may suggest unidentified activity or an action that couldn't be logged properly due to insufficient permissions or a system error.

From available system log data, there doesn't appear to be any immediate issues - all the system logs pertain to regular operations such as cache flushing, session success or ongoing tasks from Ansible. Yet, missing details in audit logs creates challenges in making an all-encompassing assertion about the system's health. 

Therefore, it would be advisable to investigate why the audit logs are showing "unknown" - whether it's due to a logging error, permissions issue, or an actual problem with system behavior. Overall, from the provided log entries, normal system and application operations seem to be taking place. The repeated "ansible-async_wrapper.py" tasks should also be checked to ensure they are expected, as persistent long-running tasks could potentially reduce system performance.
