The main types of messages in these logs are:

1. Info messages from the `ansible-async_wrapper.py` program on both machines ("vm-1a" and "vm-2a")
2. Info messages about the system processes ("systemd[1]") on machine "vm-1a"
3. "Unknown" messages from the `audit.log` files on machine "vm-1a"

It is difficult to provide a lot of detailed analysis without further context, but here are the key details for each type of message:

1. The `ansible-async_wrapper.py` messages indicate that an Ansible process with a specific process ID (e.g., 2240 or 2232) is still running at various timestamps. Ansible is a tool for IT automation, so this might suggest that a repetitive task is being performed on both servers.
2. The systemd messages indicate the start and end of user sessions on machine "vm-1a". `systemd` is the system and service manager for Linux systems. These log entries are indicating that a user session ("Session 17") for user "student" was started and then ended successfully.
3. The numerous "unknown" messages in the `audit.log` files on machine "vm-1a" lack specifics, making it difficult to provide a definitive analysis without additional information.

Recurring patterns and repeated messages:

1. The message "ansible-async_wrapper.py: still running" recurs in the logs on both servers. The frequency of these messages suggests that Ansible jobs are running repeatedly, probably scheduled to automate some tasks.
2. The 'unknown' records in the audit log on the "vm-1a" are repeated frequently which may suggest some issue with the audit logging on this machine.

The unknown entries could be the results of a problem causing the audit logging to not work correctly or they are placeholder logs that don't contain any concrete information.

Based on the logs provided, most of the system processes seem to be running as expected with session scopes succeeding on "vm-1a" and Ansible processes still running on both machines. However, the "unknown" messages in the `audit.log` files on "vm-1a" could potentially indicate a problem, but it would be speculative without further investigation and more context.
