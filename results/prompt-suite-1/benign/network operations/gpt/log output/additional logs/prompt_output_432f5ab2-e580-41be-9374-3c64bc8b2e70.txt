1. Main types of messages include errors, informational logs, and status logs.

- Errors: Messages mentioning an error, for instance, the logs have numerous errors generated by gce_workload_cert_refresh service when connecting to the 'instance/gce-workload-certificates/config-status' server. This error might prevent the correct configuration of workload certificates.

- Informational Logs: Logs indicating the progress of a certain task, for instance, logs related to Ansible asynchronous tasks are repeated multiple times, indicating that they are still running.

- Status Logs: Messages indicating the start or completion of services, for instance, the messages related to system daemon (systemd) starting and completing certain services.

2. For each type:

- Errors: These logs provide information such as time of occurrence, source of error, the actual error, the task or process that encountered the error. 

- Informational Logs: These logs provide details about ongoing tasks or operations, the time of the log, process ID and the state of the operation.

- Status Logs: These logs offer details such as the start and completion time of services, service names, and service status.

3. Recurring patterns or repeated messages include:

- The Ansible asynchronous tasks are long-running and are repeatedly logged as 'still running'.
- Errors trying to get config status from the 'instance/gce-workload-certificates/config-status' server.
- The audit.log has numerous 'unknown' messages.

4. Potential causes of errors or warnings:

- The gce_workload_cert_refresh service error may be caused by an unreachable or non-existent server 'instance/gce-workload-certificates/config-status'. 
- The 'unknown' log records from the audit.log could be due to missing information or misconfiguration in the logging system.

5. System Status Based on Logs: 

- The system has operations that are taking a considerable amount of time to complete as indicated by the 'still running' logs. Regular review may be required to determine if these operations complete successfully or time out.
- The system is experiencing a configuration error because gce_workload_cert_refresh cannot reach a designated server.
- The audit logs seem to have issues recording meaningful data, as the log entries are marked as 'unknown'. 
- Despite these issues, many system services (such as systemd sessions) appear to start and finish successfully.
