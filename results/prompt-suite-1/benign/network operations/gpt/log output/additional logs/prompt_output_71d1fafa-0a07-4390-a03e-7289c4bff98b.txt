The main types of messages in these logs include:

1. Informational messages: These messages are marked by the "ansible-async_wrapper.py: XXXX still running" log from the /var/log/syslog file, which indicates that an Ansible process is running. The key details provided include the timestamp of the log, the name of the machine (vm-1a or vm-2a), the file from which the log comes, and the process ID.

2. Audit logs: These messages come from the /var/log/audit/audit.log file. These are system audit logs which are designed to record events for security monitoring purposes. However, the details of these log records are marked as unknown, which makes it difficult to gather specific information.

The recurring pattern that can be seen is that there are several mentions of an Ansible async wrapper process still running on both machines (vm-1a and vm-2a). This could mean a long-running task is being performed or that there may be an issue causing this task to not finish. 

Many of the log records from the audit.log are 'unknown,' which might suggest an issue with the logging system or the audit system, but without more information, it is hard to determine the precise problem.

From these logs, it is challenging to summarize the overall health and state of the system as significant information related to audit logs is unknown. The continuous running of the Ansible async wrapper process might indicate a long-running task or an issue that needs further investigation. In summary, the logs don't show any immediate critical problem, but there is a need for further investigation on the unknown audit logs and the persistent Ansible process.
