The logs primarily contain audit records from Linux's audit daemon (auditd), which are neither errors, warnings, or info messages. Instead, they record the activities and events on a Linux system for security auditing purposes. 

1. USER_ACCT: This type of message appears when a user account is successfully accessed. Key details provided include the userID, and details of the user's account. 

2. CRED_ACQ: This message is logged when a user acquires credentials. It includes details such as process id, user id, user's audit id, and the name of the user who acquired credentials.

3. LOGIN: This log message is recorded when the login event occurs. Information provided includes pid (process id), uid (user id), auid (audit uid), old-auid (old audit uid), and ses (session id).

4. SYSCALL: It logs system call made by a process. It provides an extensive amount of information like pid, uid, gid, syscall id, exit value, syscall arguments and executable that made the syscall.

5. PROCTITLE: This records the proctitle set by prctl.

6. USER_START: This logs the start of a new user session with details about the user and session.

7. USER_END: This logs the end of a user session.

8. USER_LOGIN: This log message is recorded when a login attempt is made.

9. USER_ERR: This records when a user error has occurred. 

Recurring patterns in the logs include lots of USER_ACCT, CRED_ACQ, LOGIN, and SYSCALL log messages. These messages are expected in normal functioning of the system as users log in and execute various commands.

Some of the log records labeled 'unknown' may indicate failed or unsuccessful activities.

There are no specific error messages in the provided logs that suggest an error or a warning state. However, the logs indicate several failed login attempts which could potentially suggest an intrusion attempt or incorrect user credentials being used.

Based on these logs, the system appears to be functioning normally, although some failed login attempts should be investigated.
