The main types of messages appear in these logs include USER_LOGIN, USER_ERR, USER_ACCT, CRED_ACQ, LOGIN, SYSCALL, PROCTITLE, USER_START, USER_END, and CRED_DISP. 

Key details for each message type typically include the process id (pid), user id (uid), audit id (auid), audit session id (ses), subject (subj), operation (op), account (acct), process name (exe), hostname, IP address (addr), and result (res). Additional details specific to the type of message are also provided (e.g., source/destination information in USER_LOGIN messages, syscall number and args/success details in SYSCALL messages etc.). For instance, USER_LOGIN messages show attempts to login, while USER_ERR messages report errors related to user operations.

The recurring pattern seems to be a continual series of failed login attempts. Specifically, many log records have entries such as 'op=login' followed by 'res=failed'. These log entries are typically associated with different IP addresses, strongly suggesting repeated login attempts, potentially indicating a brute force attack. 

The USER_ERR messages ('op=PAM:bad_ident') can be caused by a variety of issues, often related to unsuccessful authentication attempts. In the context of these logs, the errors appear to originate from failed login attempts to the sshd service, potentially again indicative of malicious activity.

Based on these logs, the overall health of the system appears to be compromised. There are numerous failed login attempts, possibly indicating a brute force attack, along with multiple user-related errors. This suggests issues with incorrect credentials being provided, nonexistent accounts being referenced, or intrusion attempts. The system may be experiencing repeated unauthorized access attempts.
