The main types of messages in these logs include USER_LOGIN, USER_ERR, USER_ACCT, CRED_ACQ, LOGIN, SYSCALL, PROCTITLE, USER_START, USER_END, CRED_DISP, and USER_ACCT.

Each type of message provides key details: 
1. USER_LOGIN: Provides information about failed login attempts including the attempted account name, the process id involved, uid, auid, session id, program executed, and source address.
2. USER_ERR: Details about errors involving bad user identification along with process id, uid, auid, source address, and failed result.
3. USER_ACCT, CRED_ACQ, LOGIN, SYSCALL, PROCTITLE, USER_START, USER_END, CRED_DISP: These are messages indicating successful user activities - logging in, acquiring credentials, opening a session, making a system call, changing the process title, ending a session. They provide the involved account name, process id, uid, auid, source address, the specific operation involved, and status of operation.
 
Recurring patterns or repeated messages include:
1. Multiple failed login attempts from a variety of IP addresses.
2. Repeated USER_ERR messages indicating a bad identification error for unknown user.

Potential causes of the errors or warnings could include:
1. A systematic or coordinated attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system (potentially a brute force attack).
2. Incorrect user accounts being used for login attempts.

Based on these logs, the overall health and status of the system seem to be under threat. There are multiple failed login attempts in a short period of time from various IP addresses and incorrect user accounts, indicating a potential security concern. However, it seems the existing security measures are functioning properly since all unauthorized attempts have failed. It could be prudent to investigate the failed login attempts further, possibly tracking the source of these attempts to identify any larger security threats.
