The logs show the creation of a file called `example.txt` within `/home/professor`. The logs denote the creation with the `nametype=CREATE` entry. The `mode=0100664` refers to the permission settings of the file (in octal form): `0664` means the owner (`ouid=1001`) has read and write permissions, members of the group (`ogid=1002`) have read and write permissions, and others have only read permission.

In the logs, there are no instances of file deletion, changes to file permissions or ownership, or any activities related to directory creation and deletion.
