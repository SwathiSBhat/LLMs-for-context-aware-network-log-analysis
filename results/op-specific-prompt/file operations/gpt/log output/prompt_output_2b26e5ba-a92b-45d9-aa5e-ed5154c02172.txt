The logs do not provide any indication or instances of file creation or deletion in the auditD logs. There are also no changes related to file permissions or ownership, nor activities related to directory creation and deletion as per the provided logs. However, there is an operation logged to change permissions with chmod command on a file (/home/professor/example.txt) performed by user professor (uid=1001) on vm-2a at 2024-06-02T22:43:36.734Z. But, it is not clear from the logs whether the permissions were actually changed or what the new permissions might be. The details of the operation are as follows:

```2024-06-02T22:43:36.734Z | SYSCALL msg=audit(1717368209.591:392): arch=c000003e syscall=268 success=yes exit=0 a0=ffffff9c a1=55ef955d01b0 a2=1ed a3=fff items=1 ppid=3154 pid=3155 auid=1001 uid=1001 gid=1002 euid=1001 suid=1001 fsuid=1001 egid=1002 sgid=1002 fsgid=1002 tty=(none) ses=13 comm="chmod" exe="/usr/bin/chmod" subj=unconfined key="create_modify_files"```

The rest of the logs are primarily focused on service status and user login activities. There is no other inode (file or directory) operation other than the aforementioned chmod.
