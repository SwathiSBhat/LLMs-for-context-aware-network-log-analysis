The audit logs provided do not show any instances of file creation or deletion, changes to file permissions or ownership, or activities related to directory creation and deletion. 

The logs mostly relate to attempts at user logins, both successful ('res=success') and failed ('res=failed'), and system processes related to user session management. Particularly, there are numerous entries related to the "sshd" service which handles SSH remote login attempts. 

For example, the log entries show several failed login attempts from different source IP addresses such as 43.163.197.120, 34.91.0.68, and 221.161.235.168. Also, a successful session was initiated by the user "professor" from the IP address 68.108.247.157. 

For more detailed analysis, it would require additional logs relating to file or directory operations.
