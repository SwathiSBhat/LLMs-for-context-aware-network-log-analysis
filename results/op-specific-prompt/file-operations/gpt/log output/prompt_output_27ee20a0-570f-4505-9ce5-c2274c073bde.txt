The auditD logs provided do not contain records of explicit file creation or deletion. It's important to note that auditD logs don't explicitly tell you when a file is created or deleted, but you can infer this by looking at 'syscall' records, as certain syscall numbers correspond to certain actions such as opening, closing, or deleting a file.

In your log information, there are changes to file permissions and ownership. Specifically, the chown command was used to change the ownership of "/home/professor/example-moved.txt" as executed by a user with uid=0 (root), for the user with the name "professor". This action was successful as indicated by "success=yes" in the log record: 

file /var/log/audit/audit.log at 2024-06-02T22:52:10.775Z, log record: type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1717368729.742:522): arch=c000003e syscall=260 success=yes exit=0 a0=ffffff9c a1=5580afd05bf0 a2=3e9 a3=ffffffff items=1 ppid=3753 pid=3754 auid=1001 uid=0 gid=0 euid=0 suid=0 fsuid=0 egid=0 sgid=0 fsgid=0 tty=(none) ses=20 comm="chown" exe="/usr/bin/chown" subj=unconfined key="create_modify_files"

Your logs don't include explicit activities related to directory creation or deletion. Similar to file creation and deletion, these actions would generally be inferred from syscall records.
