From the provided logs, there are indications of file creation and deletion:

A file was renamed/moved, which can be treated as a form of deletion/creation:

- A file named "example.txt" was renamed to "example-moved.txt" under the "/home/professor/" directory. The event was triggered by the user with auid=1001 and uid=1001, gid=1002 using the "mv" command as denoted by the executable "/usr/bin/mv". This occurred on June 2, 2024 at timestamp 1717368512.188. The event details are captured in multiple logs: type=SYSCALL, type=CWD, type=PATH (4 instances), and type=PROCTITLE.

There is no explicit log entry indicating direct file creation or deletion. There are also no direct changes in file permissions and ownership indicated in these logs.

For directory creation or deletion, there aren't any such activities recorded in these logs. The closest is the access to "/home/professor/" directory during the renaming/moving of a file, but it doesn't indicate the directory was created or deleted.
