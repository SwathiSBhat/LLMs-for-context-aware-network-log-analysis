Looking at the logs provided, there aren't any instances of file creation or deletion recorded in the /var/log/audit/audit.log files. Also, there aren't any changes to file permissions or ownership noted in these logs. There's an occurrence of a symbolic link creation (ln command is used), but it's not an actual file creation or deletion operation. The user 'professor' appeared to have moved a file named 'example-moved.txt' and made a symbolic link named 'example-symlink.txt' to it.

Similarly, we do not observe any activities related to directory creation or deletion.

However, it is important to caution that we do see multiple failed login attempts for unknown users and invalid users (represented by hexadecimal values 28756E6B6E6F776E207573657229 and 28696E76616C6964207573657229 respectively) in logs in both vm-2a and vm-1a. The failed login attempts appear to be from various IP addresses which may indicate an attempted intrusion or unauthorized access. We also see a user named 'professor' successfully logging in and doing some actions, possibly creating a symlink. 

A comprehensive security analysis might need to check network logs or additional VM or system logs to cross-verify these activities and potential anomalies or threats.
