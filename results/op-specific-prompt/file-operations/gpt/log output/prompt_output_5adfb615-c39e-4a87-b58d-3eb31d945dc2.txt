Based on the provided logs, there is one instance of a file creation:

- A file named "archive.tar.gz" was created in directory "/home/professor" by uid=1001 (who is likely the user 'professor') with the command represented as '746172002D637A766600617263686976652E7461722E677A006578616D706C652D6D6F7665642E747874' which corresponds to "tar -czvf archive.tar.gz example-moved.txt".

There don't appear to be any instances of file deletions, file permission changes, or activities related to directory creation or deletion according to the logs provided.

Note: It may be useful to further investigate the activity of the user, as the creation of a tar.gz file may suggest a preparation for file transfer. The file creation is done using the tar command and flags -czvf which means create, zip (compress), verbose (show progress), and file (followed by the file name).
