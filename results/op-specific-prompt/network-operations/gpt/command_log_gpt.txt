Command: netstat -tuln
Return Value: 1. Network Connection Attempts:

There seems to be a series of SSH connections established from the IP Address 68.108.247.157.

2. SSH Login Attempts:

The logged data indicates a successful SSH login attempt by a user named "professor" from IP address 68.108.247.157. The login was executed with root privileges as indicated by "uid=0".

3. Network Services Usage:

It's noticeable that the `sshd` service has been used for SSH connections. Looking at the log sequence, it follows a pattern of USER_ACCT -> CRED_ACQ -> LOGIN -> SYSCALL -> PROCTITLE -> USER_START -> CRED_ACQ -> USER_END -> CRED_DISP. This pattern indicates that a user session is being started and stopped, which suggests that the service is being actively used for SSH sessions but there aren't any explicit log entries about start and stop of the sshd service. However, one can infer that the sshd service is running on the system.

Command: ip -s link
Return Value: Based on the logs provided, there appears to be activities around network connections and SSH login attempts:

1. Network connection attempts: There's clear evidence of networking activities, although specific connection attempts are obscured as "unknown" in the initial logs. At one point, there's a network activity involving the IP address 68.108.247.157, although it's unspecified whether this marks an attempt to connect to the network or merely a transaction within an already established connection.

2. SSH login: An account named "professor" has performed login actions via SSH. It's stated in multiple instances with different session and process IDs. The user logged in from an IP address: 68.108.247.157. The log suggests successful login attempts considering the return status given as "success" in several entries.

3. Network Services Utilization: As for the usage of the network services, it seems that there were several processes executed under "sshd" (Secure Shell Daemon) service. There's evidence of user authentication, session initiation, and session closure corresponding to the "USER_ACCT", "USER_START", and "USER_END" log entries respectively. The "sshd" service is utilized to facilitate the SSH login attempts.

However, it's important to note that a significant amount of logging information is marked as "unknown". Hence, to get further insights, it would be necessary to have more detailed logs. If these unknown entries indicate potential security concerns, it would be advisable to investigate them further.

Command: sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
Return Value: Analyzing the given logs, the following patterns have been identified:

1. Network Connection Attempts:

There have been multiple instances of network connections from the IP address '68.108.247.157'. These can be seen in the audit logs where the ssh daemon '/usr/sbin/sshd' is executed.

2. SSH Login Attempts:

An SSH login attempt were performed by the user 'professor' from the IP address '68.108.247.157'. This can be determined from the log entries showing 'accounting grantors=pam_permit acct="professor" exe="/usr/sbin/sshd"' and 'hostname=68.108.247.157'. 

3. Network Service Usage:

From the audit logs, it can be seen that:

   - A session was initiated by the 'professor' account using the ssh daemon. This was recorded with the log message                  'op=PAM:session_open'.
   
   - A sudo operation was executed, performing the command '73797374656D642D7265736F6C7665202D2D666C7573682D636163686573'. The user performing this sudo operation was 'root', and the operation was successful ('res=success').
   
   - Two sessions associated with the 'root' and 'professor' accounts were closed ('op=PAM:session_close'). This may indicate that a user logged out or a service was stopped during these sessions.

In summary, there is a prominent pattern of the user 'professor' initiating a session via SSH from the IP address '68.108.247.157', performing operations as root, and then closing the session.

Unknown logs entries exist in log records and they might require further investigation as there seems to be not enough information for an accurate summary.

----------------------
Command: route -n
Return Value: 1. Network Connection Attempts:
   There are two network connections recorded that were initiated from different IP addresses:

    - IP address "68.108.247.157" initiated multiple connection attempts, with several USER_ACCT, CRED_ACQ, LOGIN, USER_START, USER_END and CRED_DISP messages - all indicating a series of successful authentication and session setup/closure events.
    - IP address "218.158.211.78" initiated one connection attempt, which resulted in a USER_ERR; the operation failed, possibly due to an incorrect SSH login, as indicated by the "bad_ident" mistake in the log message.

2. SSH Login Attempts:
    - A successful SSH login attempt was recorded for the "professor" account coming from IP address "68.108.247.157". As indicated by CRED_ACQ for "professor", Login messages, and USER_START with username "professor", this SSH session was successfully started and then closed normally, according to the log messages USER_END and CRED_DISP for "professor".
    - IP address "218.158.211.78" tried to establish an SSH connection but an error was logged due to a bad identification: "PAM:bad_ident". As a result, the username associated with this failed SSH connection attempt is unknown.

3. Network Services Usage:
   sshd, the Secure Shell Daemon service, seems to have been significantly utilized, as shown in the logs. The logs specifically mark the start and end of individual sessions via sshd, which listens for connections from clients. It initiates setup of secure sessions after client connection. There is no explicit log entry here indicating that the sshd service itself started or stopped; rather, they show the beginning and ending of user sessions over SSH.
