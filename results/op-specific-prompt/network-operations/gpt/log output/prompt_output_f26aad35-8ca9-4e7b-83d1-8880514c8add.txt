Analyzing the given logs, the following patterns have been identified:

1. Network Connection Attempts:

There have been multiple instances of network connections from the IP address '68.108.247.157'. These can be seen in the audit logs where the ssh daemon '/usr/sbin/sshd' is executed.

2. SSH Login Attempts:

An SSH login attempt were performed by the user 'professor' from the IP address '68.108.247.157'. This can be determined from the log entries showing 'accounting grantors=pam_permit acct="professor" exe="/usr/sbin/sshd"' and 'hostname=68.108.247.157'. 

3. Network Service Usage:

From the audit logs, it can be seen that:

   - A session was initiated by the 'professor' account using the ssh daemon. This was recorded with the log message                  'op=PAM:session_open'.
   
   - A sudo operation was executed, performing the command '73797374656D642D7265736F6C7665202D2D666C7573682D636163686573'. The user performing this sudo operation was 'root', and the operation was successful ('res=success').
   
   - Two sessions associated with the 'root' and 'professor' accounts were closed ('op=PAM:session_close'). This may indicate that a user logged out or a service was stopped during these sessions.

In summary, there is a prominent pattern of the user 'professor' initiating a session via SSH from the IP address '68.108.247.157', performing operations as root, and then closing the session.

Unknown logs entries exist in log records and they might require further investigation as there seems to be not enough information for an accurate summary.
