From the logs, it seems there's been a single network connection attempt via SSH protocol. The connection request was from the IP address 68.108.247.157. 

Details of SSH login attempts:
- There was a successful SSH login attempt by the user "professor" from the IP address 68.108.247.157. This can be confirmed from USER_ACCT, CRED_ACQ, LOGIN, and SYSCALL log records. 

Details of usage of network services: 
- An SSHD service was started by the "professor". This is detailed in the USER_START log record, which signifies the start of a new session. 
- The session was shortly closed as described in the USER_END log record. During the session, the permission/rights were set by various PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) modules.

In all logs, the process (command, also known as 'comm') involved in these operations was sshd, a daemon that provides the SSH protocol.
  
Please note, the audit log records with the 'log record: unknown' did not provide any useful information for this analysis.
