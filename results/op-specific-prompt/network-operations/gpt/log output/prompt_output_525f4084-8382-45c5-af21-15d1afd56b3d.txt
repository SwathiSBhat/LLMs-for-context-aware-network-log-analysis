3. Network Services Usage:

It's noticeable that the `sshd` service has been used for SSH connections. Looking at the log sequence, it follows a pattern of USER_ACCT -> CRED_ACQ -> LOGIN -> SYSCALL -> PROCTITLE -> USER_START -> CRED_ACQ -> USER_END -> CRED_DISP. This pattern indicates that a user session is being started and stopped, which suggests that the service is being actively used for SSH sessions but there aren't any explicit log entries about start and stop of the sshd service. However, one can infer that the sshd service is running on the system.
