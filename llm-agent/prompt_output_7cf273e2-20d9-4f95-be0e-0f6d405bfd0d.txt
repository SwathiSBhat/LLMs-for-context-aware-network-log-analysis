The main types of messages in these logs are categorized under User Sessions, Credit Operations, Audit, and Service Operations. They are not necessarily classified as errors, warnings, or info, but it's rather a mix of these categories depending on the operation.

Here are the key details provided for each type of message:

1. User Sessions: These messages include USER_START, USER_END, USER_ERR, and USER_CMD. They detail operations such as the start and end of user sessions, execution of specific commands, opening and closing of sessions. Details provided include the user id (uid), audit id (auid), process id (pid), session id (ses), operation, hostname, and result status. 

2. Credit Operations: These are messages categorized as CRED_REFR, CRED_DISP which involve setting and disposing of credentials respectively. They provide details on the user, the executable involved, and the result status.

3. Audit: These are messages that include USER_ACCT, which involves user accounting. They provide details like the user, executable, operation, and the result of the operation. 

4. Service Operations: These include SERVICE_START, SERVICE_STOP which, as the names suggests, are related to the starting and stopping of services. They provide information about the unit/service being started or stopped, the action (comm), the executable file (exe) and the result status.

The recurring pattern in these logs involves the usage of the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for user authentication and logging, starting and stopping of "gce-workload-cert-refresh" service, failed login attempts, and instances of setting and disposing of user credentials.

The potential causes of errors could be unauthorized access attempts as evidenced by 'op=PAM:bad_ident' which indicates incorrect user identity used during ssh login attempts.

Based on these logs, the overall health and status of the system seem to be functioning normally, except for sporadic unsuccessful ssh access attempts, which could suggest potential security risks. Also, 'gce-workload-cert-refresh' service is repeatedly being started and stopped, its impact would depend on the context and set up of this environment. Regular monitoring and appropriate measures to mitigate these risks is recommended. Some log records are marked as "unknown", which may indicate logging issues or unrecorded activities which might need investigation.
